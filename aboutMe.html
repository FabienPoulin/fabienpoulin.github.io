									<blockquote style="text-align: justify;">Hello guys ! <br><br>
										I'm Fabien Poulin, a Software Engineering student located in Canada which discovered coding (surprisingly) in my first year of University, two years ago.<br><br>
										If you contact me, we can talk in French, English and even Spanish if needed, but my spanish is learned around work, so I might have difficulties to handle a conversation about crocodiles.  <br><br>
										
										I enjoy hiking, gaming and solving problems. I am a grounded guy who believe that conversation is the key in a lot of problems and I really like to hang out with people who discuss about ideas on how to make things better.<br><br>
										I am a team player, so if you want to have my in your team, feel free to contact me on my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabienpoulin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> LinkedIn </a> ! Thanks a lot for your time by the way, I honestly appreciate it !

									<u>University Life:</u><br> 
								Let's start with this picture above, this is my crew ! I was lucky enough to be elected twice as the President of <a href="http://aeglo.ift.ulaval.ca/"  target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AEGLO. </a>
								AEGLO is a french acronym, it is the student association of Software Engineers at Laval University, Qc. <br>
								  <br>
								I still have 2 more years to do a University Laval, but I will be looking for an internship every summers till the completion of this Software Engineering degree !
								<br><br>
								  <u>
									  Work Life:
								  </u><br>
								I had the chance to do two internship at <a href="https://samplingproduct.com/en_ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> SI Tactic</a> as a programmer analyst, and those have been amazing (which is why I've been there twice) !
								Not only the team is great, but I was able to learn so much about so many fields ! Honestly, if you have the chance, I recommend you to check their website, they deserve to be known.
								<br><br>
								Before that, I was a sales representative for Virgin Mobile (Bell) during 8 awesome years ! 
								Even though I love what I am doing right now as I get new challenges everyday, I honestly miss my <strike>customers, colleagues, boss</strike> <I>friends</I>. I don't even know if  the word "friend" is strong enough,
								these people were part of my family ! I hope you are all doing great by the way guys.
								<br><br><u>
									Project Life:
								</u><br>	
								As of 20-05-2022, I am finishing "TIPI'S QUEST 2" which I will play with my closest friends this summer, ON MY HOUSE with my projector, like we did before covid with "TIPI'S QUEST".
								I can't wait to show this to you guys !<br>
								<br>
								As of 20-05-2022, I am completing my first videogame ever that will be published on STEAM ! Inspired by the "TIPI'S QUEST" serie, this game will be a multiplayer party game with AT LEAST 50 unlockable characters !
								<br><br>
								As of 20-05-2022, I am working on this Portfolio website ! By the way, feel free to send me constructive comments on LinkedIn, I am not perfect and will never be, but I am always willing to improve !
